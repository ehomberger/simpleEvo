# Mutations
  - can / should mutations be their own class or just remain within the organics
  - should each individual mutation have a chance of occurring or should there be
    an overall chance of mutation occurring, and then a probability of a specific
    mutation happening? 
        - need to find out more about how mutations actually work and how often
          they happen
