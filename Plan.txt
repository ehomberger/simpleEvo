======================######## Fully Implemented ########=======================
- Color changing object
- Importing and initializing nutrient maps
- Throwing a 90kg stone 300m

======================###### Partially Implemented ######=======================
- DNA class
  - Mutations
    - Mutations are a bit of fun right now, 3 variations are set up, but i found
      out that there are 4 other typical types of mutation, so will probably throw
      those in.
    - Would it be a good idea to make mutations a class inside of organics?
      -might have 0 benefit
    - Mutation function parameters are hella inconsistent, needs to make up my
      goddamn mind on this one
  - Need to make some type of "reproduce with" function for combining two DNA objects
    to produce a combined offspring

- Size
  - Trees change size at varying rates depending on their available nutrients

- Nutrients
  - Nutrient maps are in place for reading and writing, but as of now organics
    only access what value is at their x,z position and don't modify it at all
  - NutritionFactor is a variable used to describe what kind of benefit the Tree
    gets from the amount of nutrient it has available, and it seems to be in a
    good place, but could use some tweeking in reality, not a huge deal

- Reproduction
  - Mutation, gene sharing, and range of Reproduction are in place, all kind of
    half-assed though
  - Thoughts on this:
        - Does the gene selection from parents need to happen in Trees class? If
          gene selection techniques are uniform across most life forms (assuming
          sexual reproduction here) can't this method be in Organics instead?



======================######## Notly Implemented ########=======================
- Health
  - Nothing really dies unless it gets placed off the map, so that's gotta
    change pretty soon here

- Nutritional needs of tree based on volumetric size

-

- Other types of plants*


*this is much later

! add some type of ranking system to make this a list of things to do

======================######## Eric's todo list ########=======================

(done)0th. Fix gitIgnore

1st. Add death
	(done)a. threshold that needs to be met
	b. make growth also be based on nutrients above threshold
	c. make threshold size dependent
2nd. General clean up
	a. Carson is right, gene selection should happen in organics
	b. General commenting/changing to defined values where applicable
3rd. Make more things dna dependent
	a. main one is reproduction 'type'
		-Trees will have a gene pair for reproduction. they can only reproduce if both trees have same value
		-should allow different 'species' to show up
	b. growth factor should be based on dna
